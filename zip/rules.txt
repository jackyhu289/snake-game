In this game, the player will be controlling a snake.
Apples are spawned in random locations, and the objective is to collect
as many apples to obtain a high score.
The player must also avoid lava tiles (denoted as red)
Note that there is a time limit for each apple, depending on its distance
from the snake head. If the time limit is reached, the player loses
There are also powerups the player can choose to get.
